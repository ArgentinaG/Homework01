Steps taken to improve the website

HTML changes:

On the head element I cleaned up the meta data by removing the extra space and removed the closing tag. I also added the companies name on the title so it may be reflected on the url. In addition on the external link I included the type tag "text/css".



On the body element I created the section tags and removed the division tags.
In the section class hero I updated all properties to reflect as ids.

I created a note of the header section enabling the links.
I created a section element for benefits. 

I removed the closing tag on benefit-cost-class

I added the alt attribute to the images.

Included a footer to the html file.

I added notes to the different sections.
